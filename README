This library generates inflections for syntactic categories including verb, noun and adjectives making use of wiktionary to generate the inflections.
Steps to run the code:
Each syntactic category will have two categories of files: *WikiXMLParser and *InflectionGeneration
For instance, VerbWikiXMLParser and VerbInflectionGeneration

WikiXMLParser parses input wiktionary dump and creates serialized output of morphological inflections mapped to input root form.
InflectionGeneration queries the serialized dump to obtain inflection forms for the input root form.

Thus for any syntactic category, *WikiXMLParser needs to be only run once.
*InflectionGeneration needs to be run everytime a root form is queried for inflections.
